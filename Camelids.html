        <h1>Camelids</h1>
        <P>
            The four llamas and two camels are camelids tend to be large and are strictly
            herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways. They have a three-
            chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract; an upper lip that is split in 
            two with each part separately mobile; and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They 
            have long legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body,
            look longer still. (from Wikipedia)
